                    The discovery of gun powder not only allowed people to make more advanced weaponry in a war, but it also changed the style of fighting. Insted of fighting man to man with swords or arrows, cannons (first made in the 16th Century) could now be made to shoot objects from a longer distance <b>and</b> do more damage.

          <h1 class="title">The Wireless Radio Station</h1>
          <p>
            The development of the radio in the late 1800's greatly affected the ways orders were issued to soldiers in World War I and II. Colonels and Generals no longer had to be nearby to communicate quickly with their battalions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Before radios were used, Colonels used dogs and pigeons to communicate with their troops. This was a risk because the animals may get shot or taken by the enemies, which could lead to information being compromised.
          </p>
          <br />
          <!-- EDIT THIS PARAGHRAPH -->
          <p>
            Unfortunately, radio was still very new in WWI, and many commanders liked to rely more on their old methods, which still worked, but were slower. News stations, however, were able to use higher powered radios to receive information which could be reported from WWI. As time progressed, radio was becoming <i>increasingly more</i> relevant. By the end of the war, the United States Navy sent it's last dispatch of World War One, to announce armistice on November 11, 1918.

          <h1 class="title">The Introduction of Poisonous Gas to WWI</h1>
          <p>
            The chlorine gas attacks at the Second Battle of Ypres in Belgium mark the beginning of Chemical Warfare. <b>Five thousand</b> troops were killed and at least ten thousand injured. Instead of attempting a "shoot to kill" method, the Germans' goals changed. They discovered that torture and death could both be done at the same time on a battlefield.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Chlorine and mustard gases quickly became feared elements in World War I because they were heavier than the air and a strong irritant to the skin, eyes, and especially the lungs. Extended exposure to the gases could lead to chemical burns, blindness, and/or long-term respiratory illnesses.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Poisonous gases quickly changed war strategies, as trench warfare became even more dangerous. Chemical Weapons have since been banned (in 1972) from use in wars for their torturous consequences to health.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Examples of poisonous gases include Chlorine Gas (WWI), Mustard Gas (WWI), Phosgene (WWI), Cyanogen Chloride (WWI), Lewisite (Late WWI), Nerve Gas (WWII), Hydrogen Cyanide (WWII), and Agent Orange. (Vietnam War)

          <h1 class="title">The Internal Combustion Engine</h1>
          <p>
            The improved Combustion Engine in the early 1900's was a breakthrough in transportation technology. When it was mass produced for tanks and warplanes in World War I, the advancement made an enormous difference in War Strategy. Planes could now air-lift doughboys and their allies over enemy lines and lead an attack from the other side! Warplanes were also fitted with machine guns to lead dog fights in the air or shoot down the enemies.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Tanks could now travel further distances on rougher terrain than their predecessor, the armored car. With more powerful engines, the tank had the power to help break the stalemate on the Western Front, in favor of the Allied Powers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In World War II, the combustion engines fueled warplanes in the Battle of Britain to protect Great Britain from Nazi control!

          <h1 class="title">The Radio Detection and Ranging System</h1>
          <p>
            The radar was heavily used after World War I. By WWII, advanced war planes were being used and submarines were taking war to the seas. Before the strike in Pearl Harbor by Japanese warplanes, radar was able to see the planes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p style="padding-left: 10px; border-left: 1px solid #92B867;">
            <i>"At first I thought there might be something wrong with the equipment,"</i> recalled Joseph Lockard - Army Private, age 19.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lockard was not the only one who doubted what he was seeing, in fact, many workers doubted the radar.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This advanced piece of equipment greatly benefitted the troops using it. Warnings could now be issued in advance of events that were about to happen. Unfortunately, the mistake of ignoring the equipment in Pearl Harbor lead to death and destruction. If they didn't ignore the signals, Americans would have had just less than an hour to prepare for the catastrophic event.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Before Radar, soldiers had to use other methods of detecting aircraft. Many of these methods involved wearing parabolic disks connected to a headset to hear planes in the distance!

          <h1 class="title">The Nuclear Warhead</h1>
          <p>
            First developed by lead physicist, Robert Oppenheimer in the Manhattan Project, the new type of bomb was originally started to combat Germany in World War II. This aggression, however, was not needed as Germany surrendered before the completion of the project. Instead, the bomb was used in Harry Truman's Presidency when the United States was in war with Japan. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Two nuclear bombs were used against Japan to end WWII: <i>Fat Boy</i> and <i>Little Boy</i>. Fat Boy was used in Nagasaki and Little Boy was used in Hiroshima. These bombs were extremely damaging to Japan's environment and left an enormous impact on the country.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Nuclear warfare stopped the US from having to go directly into Japan and limited the number of US casualties fighting the Japanese. This strategy is called Indirect Approach.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The creation of nuclear weapons, however, began a new age of weaponry. If not controlled, these bombs could cause mass destruction of populations and ecosystems. This new power also lead to the Cold War, as the Soviet Union rivaled the United States' power.
